# 🃏 Story Point Estimation Helper

A sleek, glassmorphism-styled tool designed to combat developer over-optimism. It takes your "gut feeling" estimate and automatically bumps it to the next Fibonacci number to account for reality.

## 🧠 The Logic
We’ve all heard the advice: "Take your best estimate and double it." This tool turns that veteran manager's wisdom into a hard requirement. By applying a **Reality Tax**, it snaps your "gut feeling" to the next step in the Fibonacci scale. If you think it’s a 3, it’s probably a 5. If you think it’s an 8, it’s already an Epic.

## 🚀 Features
* **Optimism Adjustment:** Automatically shifts your estimate up one level in the Fibonacci scale.
* **Epic Detection:** Triggers a warning if the final result is **13 or higher**, suggesting the task be broken down.
* **Modern UI:** High-end glassmorphism design with backdrop blur and radial gradients.
* **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

## 🛠️ Quick Start
1. Save the project code as `index.html`.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.
3. Select an estimate and face the truth.
